Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.

Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.

Now, using the same array from above, use the select method to extract all odd numbers into a new array.

Append 11 to the end of the original array. Prepend 0 to the beginning.

Get rid of 11. And append a 3.

Get rid of duplicates without specifically removing any one value.

Create a Hash, with one key-value pair, using both Ruby syntax styles.

Suppose you have a hash h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}
1. Get the value of key `:b`.

2. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`

3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5

h[:b]

h[:e] = 5

Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to delete all of the words that begin with an "s" in the following array.
Then recreate the arr and get rid of all of the words that start with "s" or starts with "w".
=end

Take the following array and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
(ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. 
Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.

Challenge: In exercise 11, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one. 
Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 11, and populate the associated data from the contact_data array. 
Hint: you will probably need to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be the Array shift and first methods.

As a bonus, see if you can figure out how to make it work with multiple entries in the contacts hash
